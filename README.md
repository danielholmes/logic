Logic Structures
================

A library that formalises logic. I'm building this while undertaking an [Introduction to Logic](https://www.coursera.org/course/intrologic), 
so the implementation and understanding is a work in progress.


Development Environment
-----------------------
1. Create a virtual environment under the directory "env":
``` virtualenv env ```
2. Activate the environment
``` source env/bin/activate ```
3. Install the dependencies
``` pip install -r ./requirements.txt ```

Running Tests
-------------
While the virtual environment is active:
``` python ./tests.py ```

Future
------
- A lexical parser for plain text input
